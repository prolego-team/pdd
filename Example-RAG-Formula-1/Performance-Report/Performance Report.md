# About

Performance reports provide transparency into a generative AI project's performance and progress. Use it for the following:

* Evaluating system performance against different tasks and data sets.
* Determining which LLMs should be used.
* Measuring task speed and cost.
* Tracking project progress.
* Predicting when a solution will perform well enough for production deployment.
